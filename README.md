# Bike Sharing Project Using Tableu 
## Overview of the Analysis 
Bikesharing Data from Des Moines. We created a vizualiztion to: 
* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week

## Results

### Trips by Weekday for Each Hour Viz
The image below demonstrates that throughout the weekday most of the rides happened in the morning between 7am and 9am and in the afternoon between 4pm to 7pm. 
During the weekends most of the rides happened between 10 am  to 8 pm. 
An explanation for this vizualization can be that the bikes are used before and after working hours during the weekdays because people use the bike to get to work and to leave work.
